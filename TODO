-script will hang if there's no console output. -- should add a timer to this loop.
--add timeouts to other areas of the script execution (e.g. SSH loops, etc.)
-see about making variables read from config file that are dependent on one another get built correctly (e.g. localDest uses $prefix. Make sure it uses a prefix passed on the cmdline)
-add "force" flag to force operations to continue (e.g. existing S3 bucket, etc.)
-check if password prompt occurs while testing SSH connection
-research migrating S3 buckets between locations (might be faster than deploying image for each region?)
--possible to use a conditional in an expect script to check?
---http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1538444/using-conditional-statements-inside-expect
--make client run non-interactively?
--look into "func"
-add check after running instance-to-ebs-ami.sh on remote instance
--pull the output file and check that it isn't empty?
-finish variable dependency stuff
-make script load defaults for variables from config file (and fail if it can't!)
-make it so an existing instance-store AMI can be re-deployed as an instance store in another zone?
